# Maurits-Koppers — Bachelor Thesis 2025

This repository contains all code used in the Bachelor's thesis project:

**_“Optimizing Multimodal Emotion Expression for an Appearance-Constrained Robot”_**

The research investigates how combinations of **light**, **sound**, and **movement** can be optimized to express the emotions of **joy**, **fear**, **anger**, and **sadness** using a low-morphology mBot robot. The project combines data analysis, behavior programming, and an online user study.
