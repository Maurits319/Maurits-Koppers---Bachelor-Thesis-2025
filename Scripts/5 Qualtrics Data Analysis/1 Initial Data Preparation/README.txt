README

This folder contains two Python scripts:
	•	data_nosound.py
	•	data_with_sound.py

Each script processes raw survey data and generates a cleaned CSV file:
	•	nosound_processed_survey_data.csv
	•	sound_processed_survey_data.csv

These files contain participant responses for the no-sound and sound conditions, respectively.

Important Note:
The two CSV files were manually combined and edited to produce a unified dataset (processed_data73.csv) for further analysis.
